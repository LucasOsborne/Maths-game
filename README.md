<h1>Math Quiz Game</h1>

This is a simple Math Quiz Game that was developed as a Year 10 school project. The game is designed to help students improve their math skills in a fun and interactive way.

<h2>How to Play</h2>

To start the game, simply run the math_quiz.py file using Python. You will be asked to enter your name and choose a difficulty level (Easy, Medium or Hard).

The game consists of four levels, each with a different type of math problem to solve. You will be presented with a question and must enter the correct answer to proceed to the next level. You will have a limited number of lives, and if you run out of lives, the game is over.

Once you complete all four levels, your score will be displayed and you will have the option to add your score to the leaderboard.
